# CMPN202-OS-Technical-Journal
This is the detailed​‍​‌‍​‍‌ technical journal describing the setup, securing, and performance analysis of a Linux server infrastructure for Module CMPN202. 
---

## 📖 Project Overview
This​‍​‌‍​‍‌ technical journal records the entire process of a dual-system Linux infrastructure setup, security enhancement, and performance testing. Throughout 7 weeks, I have designed and built a secure **Headless Ubuntu Server** which is only accessible via SSH from a dedicated **Linux ​‍​‌‍​‍‌Workstation**.

### Key Objectives
* **Infrastructure Design:** Deploying an isolated dual-system architecture using VirtualBox.
* **Security Hardening:** Implementing industry-standard controls including SSH key-based authentication, UFW firewalls, Fail2Ban intrusion detection, and AppArmor access control.
* **Sustainability:** Optimizing the operating system for reduced energy consumption through headless configuration and resource management.
* **Performance Analysis:** Conducting quantitative stress testing to identify bottlenecks and validate system behaviour under load.
