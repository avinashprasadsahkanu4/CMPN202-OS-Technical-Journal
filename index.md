## 📖 Project Overview
This technical journal documents the end-to-end deployment, security hardening, and performance analysis of a dual-system Linux infrastructure. Over the course of 7 weeks, I have designed and implemented a secure **Headless Ubuntu Server** managed exclusively via SSH from a dedicated **Linux Workstation**[cite: 15, 16].

### Key Objectives
* **Infrastructure Design:** Deploying an isolated dual-system architecture using VirtualBox.
* **Security Hardening:** Implementing industry-standard controls including SSH key-based authentication, UFW firewalls, Fail2Ban intrusion detection, and AppArmor access control[cite: 42, 66].
* **Sustainability:** Optimizing the operating system for reduced energy consumption through headless configuration and resource management.
* **Performance Analysis:** Conducting quantitative stress testing to identify bottlenecks and validate system behaviour under load.
